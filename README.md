- ✊ Hi, I’m @sayan07dz  
- 👁️‍🗨️ I’m interested in pushing past all limits — mastering full-stack development, cybersecurity, and AI, to reshape the digital walls that confine us.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning life and the philosophies that define true freedom. 
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge the norm — systems that fight inefficiency, just like the Survey Corps battles Titans.  
- 📫 How to reach me: Reach out via [Telegram](#) or send a raven... kidding, email me at sayanpati18@gmail.com  
- ⚔️ Pronouns: He/Him (But I respond to “Scout” too)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: No Fun in Life.
